## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course presents tools, techniques, algorithms, and programming techniques using the Python programming language for data intensive applications and decision making. The course formally introduces techniques to: (i) gather, (ii) store, and (iii) process large volumes of data to make informed decisions. Such techniques find applicability in many engineering application areas, including communication systems, embedded systems, smart grids, robotics, Internet, and enterprise networks, or any network where information flows and alters decision making.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The objectives are to

* learn how to **design and program** python applications.
* learn how to use **lists, tuples, and dictionaries** in python programs
* learn how to **write loops and decision statements** in python.
* learn how to **read and write files** in python.
* **extract and analyze data** in python.
* learn how to use **indexing and slicing** to access data in python programs.
* **prepare for** their **future career** in Technology related fields.

## FORMAT AND STRUCTURE

* This course is offered on-campus Monday evenings from 6:30 PM until 9 PM. Attendance and active participation are ***required***. To access the course materials online, please visit stevens.edu/canvas. For more information about course access or support, please contact Client Support Services at support@stevens.edu or 201-380-6599.
* This is a highly participatory class. You will be writing and examining Python programs during class. (Please bring your laptop to class).
* The course calendar, located at the end of this syllabus, is subject to change. Any changes that may be required will be announced in-class and/or in a Canvas Announcement.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

### Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity

*All Stevens graduate students promise to be fully truthful and avoid dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation, and deceit of any type in relation to their academic work. A student’s submission of work for academic credit indicates that the work is the student's own. All outside assistance must be acknowledged. Any student who violates this code or who knowingly assists another student in violating this code shall be subject to discipline.* </br>
</br>
All graduate students are bound to the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity by enrollment in graduate coursework at Stevens. It is the responsibility of each graduate student to understand and adhere to the Graduate Student Code of Academic Integrity. More information including types of violations, the process for handling perceived violations, and types of sanctions can be found at www.stevens.edu/provost/graduate-academics.

## EXAM ROOM CONDITIONS

The following procedures apply to quizzes and exams for this course. As the instructor, I reserve the right to modify any conditions set forth below by printing revised Exam Room Conditions on the quiz or exam.

## LEARNING ACCOMODATIONS

Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision of accommodations on a case-by-case basis.

### Disability Services Confidentialy Policy

Student Disability Files are kept separate from academic files and are stored in a secure location within the Office of Disability Services. The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34CFR, Part 99) regulates disclosure of disability documentation and records maintained by Stevens Disability Services. According to this act, prior written consent by the student is required before our Disability Services office may release disability documentation or records to anyone. An exception is made in unusual circumstances, such as the case of health and safety emergencies. </br>
</br>
For more information about Disability Services and the process to receive accommodations, [visit](https://www.stevens.edu/office-disability-services). If you have any questions please contact: Phillip Gehman, the Director of Disability Services Coordinator at Stevens Institute of Technology at pgehman@stevens.edu or by phone (201) 216-3748.

## INCLUSIVITY

### Name and Pronoun Usage

As this course includes group work and in-class discussion, it is vitally important for us to create an educational environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor of the necessary changes.

### Inclusion Statement

Stevens Institute of Technology believes that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and innovation. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to your instructor to make alternative arrangements. </br>
</br>
You are expected to treat your instructor and all other participants in the course with courtesy and respect. Disrespectful conduct and harassing statements will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary actions. </br>

## MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES

Part of being successful in the classroom involves a focus on your whole self, including your mental health. While you are at Stevens, there are many resources to promote and support mental health. The Office of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers free and confidential services to all enrolled students who are struggling to cope with personal issues (e.g., difficulty adjusting to college or trouble managing stress) or psychological difficulties (e.g., anxiety and depression). Appointments can be made by phone (201-216-5177). </br>

## EMERGENCY INFORMATION

In the event of an urgent or emergent concern about the safety of yourself or someone else in the Stevens community, please immediately call the Stevens Campus Police at 201-216-5105 or on their emergency line at 201-216-3911. These phone lines are staffed 24/7, year-round. For students who do not reside near the campus and require emergency support, please contact your local emergency response providers at 911 or via your local police precinct. Other 24/7 national resources for students dealing with mental health crises include the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) and the Crisis Text Line (text “Home” to 741-741).
